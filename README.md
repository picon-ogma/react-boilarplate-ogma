# Project Structure ⚛️

A scalable, and powerful architecture for building production ready React applications.

## Why
In our codebase, we occasionally face challenges such as disorganized files and folders, inconsistent naming conventions (e.g., authLogin, Alert-Modal, use_UserList), heavy components, magic strings/numbers, and issues with lazy loading and routing. These challenges are often not the result of individual or team shortcomings, but rather stem from unclear guidelines or unconventional choices.

To address these issues effectively, it would be beneficial to establish and adhere to clear, standardized practices and guidelines. This will help ensure consistency, improve code quality, and facilitate better collaboration among team members.

## Philosophy
This repository offers a set of conventions for React applications, designed to be scalable and maintainable using some of the best tools available. Drawing inspiration from proven frameworks like Next.js and Remix, this architecture provides a solid foundation based on my experience with various codebases.

While it may not be a one-size-fits-all solution, it aims to support a range of applications with these core principles:

- Easy to start with, including clear documentation
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Utilizes appropriate tools for each task
- Maintains clean boundaries between different parts of the application
- Ensures team alignment on practices and processes
- Prioritizes security, performance, and scalability

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template with full of components or framework but rather an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for **you and your team** and stay consistent with your style.

The tools and libraries mentioned are recommendations; you can choose alternatives that better suit your needs. Adapting the approach to fit your project and team is perfectly acceptable and encouraged.
