# ðŸ’» Application Overview

The sample application has been bootstrapped using `Vite` and its `react` template. It allows us to create applications quickly without dealing with a complex tooling setup such as bundling, transpiling etc. Another reason for using Vite is simplicity, as it doesn't force us to use the meta-framework specific things, and allows us to focus on React.

## Get Started

Prerequisites:

- Node 20+
- Yarn 1.22+

To set up the app execute the following commands.

cd your-desired-project-name
cp .env.example .env

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

##### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
